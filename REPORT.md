- **Action Space**: 4 discrete actions (no-op, main engine, left/right orientation engines)
- **Reward Structure**: Positive rewards for successful landing, negative rewards for crashes and fuel consumption
- **Success Criterion**: Average reward of 200+ over 100 consecutive episodes

### 1.2 Motivation

This project demonstrates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning to real-world control problems. The LunarLander environment serves as a proxy for various aerospace and robotics applications, including:
- Autonomous spacecraft landing
- Drone navigation and landing
- Robotic arm control
- Autonomous vehicle control

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Deep Q-Network (DQN) Algorithm

DQN extends the traditional Q-learning algorithm by using deep neural networks to approximate Q-values. The key innovations include:

#### 2.1.1 Experience Replay
- **Purpose**: Breaks temporal correlations in sequential experiences
- **Implementation**: Circular buffer storing (state, action, reward, next_state, done) tuples
- **Benefits**: Stabilizes training, improves sample efficiency

#### 2.1.2 Target Network
- **Purpose**: Provides stable targets for Q-value updates
- **Implementation**: Separate network updated less frequently than the main network
- **Benefits**: Reduces overestimation bias, stabilizes training

#### 2.1.3 Epsilon-Greedy Exploration
- **Purpose**: Balances exploration and exploitation
- **Implementation**: Decaying epsilon from 1.0 to 0.01
- **Benefits**: Ensures sufficient exploration while converging to optimal policy
